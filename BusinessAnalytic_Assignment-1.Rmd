#Finding the number of observations (rows) in the dataset

max(Carseats$Advertising)


#Calculating Interquartile Range of the price attribute
IQR(Carseats$Price)


#Plotting Sales against Price
plot(Carseats$Price, Carseats$Sales, main = "Sales against Price plot ", xlab = "Price", ylab = "Sales")
#Observations - The two variables x=Price and y=Sales have a negative association because it is noticed that as the price increases the sales of carseats decreases.


#Calculating the correlation of two attributes (Sales and Price)
cor(Carseats$Sales, Carseats$Price)
#Observations - We have considered the correlation between sales and price where the correlation value is -0.4449507. Here the value lies between 0 and -1 therefore it is considered to have a negative or inverse correlation.
